% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \supervisor command

% This is the department committee chairman, not the thesis committee

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  The dotted
% lines for the signatures are made with the \signature command.
\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.

% Uncomment the next line if you do NOT want a page number on your
% abstract and acknowledgments pages.

\section*{Acknowledgments}\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}


I am indebted to many people who both directly and indirectly
contributed to this thesis.  First, I would like to thank those
collaborators who directly contributed.  Most of all, I'm grateful
for the help and friendship of Mark Styczynski. Mark was my
collaborator on all matters computational for the past four years
--- his influence is evident throughout this document.  I'm also
grateful for my collaboration with Christopher Loose, who performed
many of the experiments on antimicrobial peptides detailed in this
thesis.  Finally, I would like to thank Isidore Rigoutsos, who
straddled the line between collaborator and advisor.  Isidore taught
me an attention to detail and a penchant for the UNIX command line
and vi editor.

Most importantly, I am indebted to Greg Stephanopoulos, my advisor,
whose guidance and support was unwavering these past six years. Greg
is the perpetual optimist --- always positive in the face of my many
failures along the way.  He also gave me the freedom to pursue
projects of my own choosing, which contributed greatly to my
academic independence, if not the selection of wise projects.

I am much obliged to my thesis committee members: my advisor Greg,
Isidore, Bill Green, and Bob Berwick.  My committee was always
flexible in scheduling and judicious in their application of both
carrots and sticks.

There are numerous people who contributed indirectly to this thesis.
First among these is my intelligent, lovely, and vivacious wife
Kathryn Miller--Jensen.  Next, my parents Carl and Julie, my sister
Heather, and my in-laws, Ron, Joyce, Suzanne, Jeff, and Mindi.
Finally, there are innumerable friends who contributed and to whom I
am greatly appreciative including Michael Raab, Joel Moxley, Bill
Schmitt, and Jatin Misra.
